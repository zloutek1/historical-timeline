# historical-timeline
The web application allows to create timelines of historical events that teachers can show to students to better learn history. The main functionality for teachers is to add new historical events (e.g. Austerlitz battle, Dec 2, 1805). Each event is represented by a date, a location, a description and an image/placeholder. Teachers can create several timelines and add events to them. All events on a timeline will be shown graphically ordered in time (no need of something complex, also some simple HTML will do it). Teachers can create some study groups (e.g. Roman Empire, Second World War, etc...) and enroll students. Teachers can add one or more timelines to each group. Students can login to the system and take part to some groups created by teachers. They will be able to see all the timelines for the specific group and add a comment to them. Searching among all events is also possible.
